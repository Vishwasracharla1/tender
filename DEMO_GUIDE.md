## ❓ Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: Does this replace our current tender system?**
A: It augments it. We integrate with your existing e-procurement portal via API. This adds AI intelligence, fraud detection, and workflow automation on top.

**Q: How accurate is the AI scoring?**
A: The system shows AI confidence scores (typically 85-95%). Evaluators can always override. It's an assistant, not a replacement for human judgment.

A: Yes! While we auto-configure based on tender type, you can add/remove/modify criteria for any tender. Templates ensure consistency.

**Q: What about data security?**
A: Built on Supabase with Row-Level Security. Each department only sees their tenders. Audit logs track all changes. UAE data residency available.

**Q: How do we handle Arabic language?**
A: RTL support can be added. AI agents support bilingual content generation (English/Arabic). UI can be localized.

**Q: What's the deployment timeline?**
A: Pilot: 4 weeks | Full deployment: 8-12 weeks | Training: 2 weeks | Includes data migration and integration.
